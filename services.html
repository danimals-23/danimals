                <p>
                    We provide the best organic and dairy-free yogurt. In addition,
                    customers can choose and customize their yogurt on our website.
                    <br>
                    We are open every day of the week, but hours may be shifted
                    on weekends. Please check out "Contact Us" page to see a detailed
                    list of our hours of operation.
                    </br>
                    
                    We have been around for over 70 years, but this year is special!
                    It is time for Yo-Go to finally go online --- we will be
                    doing online deliveries for customers starting today! However,
                    customers still have the option to pick up their orders in person,
                    at our address: 221b Baker St.
                    
                    <br>
                    Keep in mind that we are very busy! We are getting over 200 orders
                    per day, so if you order during a busy time, it might be faster
                    for you to pick up your order in person, rather than wait for
                    us to deliver it!
