    <p> My name is Daniel Peng (he/him). </p>
    
    <p> I am a freshman at Tufts, and I am planning on majoring in Computer
        Science! </p>
        
    <p> My IP address is 130.64.35.19. </p>
    
    <p> I grew up in Newton, MA., and I moved to Acton-Boxborough in 3rd grade.
        </p>
    
    <p> Something nobody would expect about me is that I got lost at the
        Arches national park when I was 13.

    <p> Here is a picture of my favorite place: the Andromeda galaxy! </p>
